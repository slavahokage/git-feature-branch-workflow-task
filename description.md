The iPhone X, pronounced "iPhone 10," was introduced at Apple's September 2017 event as a classic "One more thing..." addition to the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus product lineup. The iPhone X has since been replaced by the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max, and Apple has discontinued the device to focus on the newer iPhones. I think Iphone X is very good.
